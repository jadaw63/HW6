# HW6
Initially I used the started code to analyze rental homes in San Fransicso neighborhoods. Some of my plots did not work as intended such as the top 10 most expensive rentals, and the parralel categories plot, the formatting made the x axis and the sales per square feet hard to read.
 I did not get my dashboards to work but started to define the visualization fucntions.
